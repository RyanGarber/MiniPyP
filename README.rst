MiniPyP

---------------------------------------
A more traditional web server in Python
---------------------------------------

About the project
=================
MiniPyP (pronounced ``miniÂ·pipe``) is an event-driven web server written in pure Python. **However, MiniPyP is not an application framework**. It's a full web server, with virtual hosts, reverse proxies, and everything else you need. MiniPyP is intended to replace Apache and nginx, so you can use Python without the performance hit of CGI.

Please note that MiniPyP is currently in planning/pre-alpha. Things may change a lot before it even gets to alpha. *Please* do not use this in any production scenario. 

Setup
=====
*Setup instructions will be available upon alpha.*
