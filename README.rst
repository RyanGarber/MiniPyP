---------------------------------------------
An all-purpose, minimalist Python web server.
---------------------------------------------

About the project
=================
MiniPyP (pronounced ``miniÂ·pipe``) is an event-driven web server written purely in Python. Its main goal is to provide an Apache/NGINX-like setup without the use of any proxies. The project is completely modular, meaning just like in the aforementioned servers, you can implement your own handlers for practically any part of the server without recompiling.

**Note:** MiniPyP is currently **very** early in development, and no form of a release date has been determined yet. That said, things shouldn't break *too* much, so feel free to use the server at your leisure.

Setup

*Setup instructions will be available soon.*
